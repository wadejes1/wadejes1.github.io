# Welcome! 

Please explore this page. I am completely new to this and am just getting started learning how to format it all! 

## Using Rmd Files 

All the files here are RMDs, knitted to the site as HTML with YAML formatting. I am an economist at the National Association of Home Builders. My interests on this page so far are going to be housing, baseball, and webscraping. I hope to update at least once a week something new to share or just add to the site in general. To checkout all my current housing blog post, please visit https://eyeonhousing.org/author/jessewade/. I typically write about a variety of housing topics ranging from housing share of GDP to mortgage rates.
